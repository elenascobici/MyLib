PROJECT DESCRIPTION
MyLib is a work-in-progress produtivity application made by a student, for students. It is designed to make assignments and studying more manageable by implementing a phase-based workflow, allowing the user to set daily goals and track their progress for every task. MyLib is very user-friendly, very simple and easy to use, and has a very clean and easy-to-navigate interface. 

LATEST CHANGES
Refactored, most notably using TypeScript instead of pure JavaScript and replacing naive txt file for user data with JSON file.
